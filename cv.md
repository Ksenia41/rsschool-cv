## About me

Hi!  Currently, I am studying JavaScript with Rolling Scopes School. I also have diverse experience in IT. I graduated from the Faculty of Applied Mathematics at BSU, worked for three years as a Business Intelligence Developer, and for the past two years, I have been working as an HR manager, helping to develop a startup. Additionally, I am constantly learning new things, and although I didn't like JavaScript in university, I decided to give it a second chance. As well, I hope this course will help me in recruiting and communication.
